### Reddit Post Templates

**Template 1: Value-First Question Response**
```
Someone asks: "What AI tools are actually worth it for small business?"

Your reply:
"I've been testing AI tools for the past 8 months running my consulting business. Here's what actually moved the needle vs. what was hype:

**Worth it:**
- ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) — I use it for drafting proposals, email responses, research
- Zapier (free tier) — Automated 6 manual tasks
- Notion AI — Great if you're already using Notion

**Not worth it (for most small businesses):**
- Most AI image tools unless you're in design/marketing
- Expensive platforms with the same features as free tools

I wrote up a more detailed breakdown here if you're interested: [link]

Happy to answer specific questions about my workflow."
```

**Template 2: Original Value Post**
```
Title: "I automated 3 hours of daily admin work with free AI tools — here's exactly how"

Body:
After running my small business for 2 years manually, I finally sat down and mapped out everything AI could handle. Result: 3 hours back per day.

Here's the exact stack (all free or cheap):
1. [specific tool] → [specific task]
2. [specific tool] → [specific task]
3. [specific tool] → [specific task]

The biggest surprise was [insight]. I documented the whole process: [link]

AMA about the setup.
```

**Template 3: Comparison Thread**
```
Title: "ChatGPT vs Claude for business tasks — 60-day honest comparison"

After paying for both for 2 months and using them for actual client work, here's my real breakdown:

[3-4 paragraph honest comparison]

Full detailed comparison with use cases: [link]

TL;DR: Claude for long-form writing, ChatGPT for variety. Neither is perfect.
```

### Reddit Rules
- ✅ Comment 5-10 times before posting a link-heavy post in any subreddit
- ✅ Keep ratio: 80% value comments, 20% link drops
- ✅ Always add genuine value before the link
- ❌ Never post the same link to multiple subs same day
