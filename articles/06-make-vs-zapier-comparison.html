        <p>I've switched between Zapier and Make three times in two years. That probably makes me a professional idiot, but it also makes me uniquely qualified to tell you which one you should actually use.</p>

        <p>Here's the context: I run a small SaaS company (15 employees) and we're deeply automation-dependent. Our entire customer onboarding, billing workflows, marketing sequences, and support routing are automated. Getting this wrong is expensive.</p>

        <p>So I've lived in both tools. Extensively. Here's what I actually know.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h4>⚡ Short Answer for Busy People</h4>
          <p><strong>Choose Zapier</strong> if you're just starting with automation, have non-technical teammates who'll manage workflows, or need to move fast.<br>
          <strong>Choose Make</strong> if you have complex workflows, need serious data manipulation, or have a technical person on the team. Also choose Make if cost is a concern — it's significantly cheaper for the same task volume.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Fundamental Difference</h2>

        <p>Zapier thinks in straight lines. When A happens, do B, then C, then D.</p>

        <p>Make thinks in branches. When A happens: if X then do B, if Y then do C, loop through D for each item in E, error handle with F.</p>

        <p>Neither is better — they're designed for different levels of complexity. Most businesses should probably start with Zapier and graduate to Make when Zapier starts feeling like wearing shoes that are too small.</p>

        <!-- IN-ARTICLE AD -->
        <div class="ad-zone ad-in-article"><span>In-Article Ad (Fluid)</span></div>

        <h2>Zapier: What It's Actually Good At</h2>

        <p>I came back to Zapier after my second attempt at Make, and I'll tell you why.</p>

        <p><strong>Setup speed is dramatically faster.</strong> I can build a working Zap in 10-15 minutes. An equivalent Make scenario might take 45 minutes, even after I became comfortable with the interface. For a busy business owner or non-technical manager, this matters enormously.</p>

        <p><strong>Error handling is clearer.</strong> When a Zap fails, Zapier tells you exactly what happened in plain English. When a Make scenario fails... you get to be a detective.</p>

        <p><strong>The App library is slightly larger.</strong> Zapier integrates with 6,000+ apps. Make is around 1,600. In practice, both cover 99% of common business apps, but for obscure integrations, Zapier wins.</p>

        <p><strong>AI features are more polished.</strong> Zapier's AI steps (which call ChatGPT directly) are easier to configure and more reliable in my testing. Make can do this too but requires more configuration.</p>

        <h2>Make: Where It Absolutely Dominates</h2>

        <p>Make (previously Integromat) was built by developers, for developers, but it's become much more accessible. Here's where it shines:</p>

        <p><strong>Pricing is brutal competition for Zapier.</strong> Make's free plan includes 1,000 operations per month (each step in a scenario is an operation). Zapier's free plan gives you 100 tasks per month — and counts each action as one task. My $49/month Zapier usage costs me about $9/month on Make. That's real money.</p>

        <p><strong>Complex data manipulation is native.</strong> Zapier handles simple field mapping. Make can loop through arrays, transform data with functions, make conditional decisions, and handle nested JSON natively. For any workflow involving more than simple data routing, Make is dramatically more powerful.</p>

        <p><strong>The visual builder is actually more intuitive for complex flows.</strong> I know this sounds backwards, but when I have a 12-step workflow with branches, seeing it visually in Make's canvas makes it easier to understand and debug than Zapier's linear list.</p>

        <p><strong>Webhooks and custom HTTP requests are first-class citizens.</strong> Zapier handles webhooks but treats them as special add-ons. In Make, calling any API is just another step. For technical users, this is huge.</p>

        <!-- IN-ARTICLE AD 2 -->
        <div class="ad-zone ad-in-article"><span>In-Article Ad (Fluid)</span></div>

        <h2>The Pricing Breakdown (This Will Shock You)</h2>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Plan Level</th><th>Zapier</th><th>Make</th><th>Tasks/Operations</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Free</td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td><td>Zapier: 100 tasks / Make: 1,000 ops</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Starter</td><td>$19.99/month</td><td>$9/month</td><td>~750 tasks / 10,000 ops</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Professional</td><td>$49/month</td><td>$16/month</td><td>~2,000 tasks / 10,000 ops</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Team</td><td>$299/month</td><td>$29/month</td><td>~50,000 tasks / 10,000 ops</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The pricing table doesn't fully capture the value difference because "tasks" and "operations" count differently. But in my real-world usage, the same workflows cost me 4-5x more on Zapier than Make.</p>

        <h2>The Learning Curve Is Real</h2>

        <p>I want to be honest about this because I see a lot of "Make is just as easy as Zapier!" claims online that don't match my experience.</p>

        <p>Make has a steeper learning curve. Not impossible — but expect to spend 5-10 hours getting comfortable with the interface before you're building confidently. The terminology is different, the logic is more complex, and when things go wrong, diagnosing them requires more patience.</p>

        <p>Zapier you can pick up in an afternoon. Make takes a weekend.</p>

        <h2>My Current Setup (And Why)</h2>

        <p>Honestly? I use both.</p>

        <p>Zapier handles all our simple one-directional workflows — things like "when Stripe processes a payment, update our database and send a receipt." Fast to set up, reliable, and my non-technical operations manager can manage them.</p>

        <p>Make handles our complex workflows — data transformation pipelines, multi-branch conditional flows, anything involving loops. It costs us less and does more.</p>

        <p>Total cost: ~$65/month for both. If I only used Zapier for everything, it'd be $200+.</p>

        <!-- IN-ARTICLE AD 3 -->
        <div class="ad-zone ad-in-article"><span>In-Article Ad (Fluid)</span></div>

        <h2>Which One Should YOU Choose?</h2>

        <p>Use this decision tree:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Non-technical and just getting started?</strong> → Zapier. Come back to Make in 6 months when you've hit its limits.</li>
          <li><strong>Budget is tight?</strong> → Make. The pricing difference alone can justify the learning curve.</li>
          <li><strong>Working with complex data or conditional logic?</strong> → Make. Zapier will frustrate you here.</li>
          <li><strong>Your team needs to manage automations?</strong> → Zapier. Non-technical teammates will struggle with Make.</li>
          <li><strong>You want AI steps?</strong> → Both have them now, but Zapier's implementation is more polished.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-takeaway">
          <h4>💡 My Actual Recommendation</h4>
          <p>Start with Zapier. It's faster to learn, more forgiving, and will handle 80% of small business automation needs. When you hit Zapier's limits — and you will — that's the right time to add Make to your stack. Don't try to learn both at once.</p>
        </div>

        <p>And remember: the best automation tool is the one you'll actually use. A simple Zapier workflow running consistently beats a theoretically superior Make scenario that you're still debugging 3 months later.</p>
